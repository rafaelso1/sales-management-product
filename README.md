# Sales Management
Considering that scenario, build a script, implementing the seller's ranking logic, where the user, from the terminal, inputs a Sale item and the output is printed as an updated list of all sales registered, sorted by sellers with the highest to lowest amount sold.

1 - Premises:
- A Sale item must have at least the following attributes: (Seller Name, Customer Name, Date of Sale, Sale Item Name, Sale Value)
- Five Sellers should be registered and no Sale Item can be registered with a different seller name other than the five available.
- Script must run in the terminal only
- Script should be delivered as a Git repository hosted in GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket with instructions on how to execute it.

2 - Development Planing:

- What technologies you would use for the front-end, back-end and why did
you choose them to build this prototype?
R: Python, because it's a powerful technology which provide solutions with easy ways in terminal.
- How much time would you estimate for building this prototype, considering you're the
only developer working on it?
R: 2 Days.

# How to execute:

1 - Download the project;

2 - Unzip the file;

3 - Go to src folder;
